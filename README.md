## About WSS :
The Winter Seminar Series (WSS) has been established to bring together successful Iranians from around the world and build a professional community focused on computer science and engineering topics. Over the years, this seminar has grown to become one of the premier events at the Sharif University of Technology. WSS is open to anyone who works in or is interested in computer science topics and seeks to share and express their ideas and research.

WSS was initiated 8 years ago by the Student Scientific Chapter at Sharif University of Technology as a global effort to connect expert researchers. Currently, WSS is held as a four-day event where speakers present their research and ideas each day, while also sharing their findings and teaching related topics.

This event comprises presentations and roundtable discussions covering various science and engineering topics. It provides a platform for networking and exchange of knowledge among participants with a shared interest in computer science and engineering.
